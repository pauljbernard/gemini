## Gemini ##

We believe that writing correct concurrent & distributed, resilient and elastic applications is too hard.
Most of the time it's because we are using the wrong tools and the wrong level of abstraction. Gemini
like the projects that inspired it also aims to make the creation of such systems simpler while also adhering
to a pure open source Apache 2.0 license.


Using the Actor Model we raise the abstraction level and provide a better platform to build correct concurrent and scalable applications. 

Actors also provide the abstraction for transparent distribution and the basis for truly scalable and fault-tolerant applications.

Gemini begins its life as a fork of the Akka project but will subsequently evolve independently.
